# Generating Game Levels
In this blog, we explore using Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) to create new synthetic game levels which can be used to train an agent to play the game through Reinforcement Learning (RL). Prior work in generating game levels using GANs (see Fig. 1) has focused on generating levels that look like real game levels and are playable. However we focus on testing if these game levels can also be used to train an RL agent and possibly help the RL agent in learning a better generalized policy for playing the game.
